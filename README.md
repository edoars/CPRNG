[“Computationally easy, spectrally good multipliers for congruential
pseudorandom number generators”](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05304), by Guy
Steele and Sebastiano Vigna.

The directory `src` contains the code used to sample multipliers.

The directory `python` contains the Python code used to select the
multipliers reported in the paper.

Python Selection Code
=====================

`gensel.py` should be run as

    ./gensel.py >best_harmonic.txt 2>best_minimum.txt

in a directory containing the databases of candidate multipliers. The
resulting two files contain for each type and size two choices, detailed
in the paper. (Our favorite choice, given size and type, is the second
choice of `best_harmonic.txt`.)
